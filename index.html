    <h1>Every decision, a universe is born.</h1>
    <p class="tagline">
      What if your choices echoed across dimensions?<br>
      Somewhere, another version of you made a different decision — and it changed everything.<br><br>
      <strong>MyLifeInfinity</strong> is not a game.<br>
      It’s a window into the lives you never lived,<br>
      shaped by the decisions you didn’t make…<br><br>
      <em>Coming soon. The you that could have been.</em>
